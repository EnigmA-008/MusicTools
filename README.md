# MusicTools

This plugin is made to support music machine makers with making music machines in 1.12.2. 

Tuning music machines becomes a hard and tedious task. This plugin has been created to make this easier.

## NoteBlockTransfer

Automates the transfer of note block tuning from one world to another, i.e. from creative world to a server.

Build the music machine in the exact same layout in creative mode and on the server.

In creative, click on `Start Recording` and follow the instructions in in-game chat. After all note blocks are recorded disable `Start Recording` and switch to `Recreate` mode. Click on `Start Recreating` and follow the instructions in in-game chat. You can `Rotate` or `Flip` the note blocks if needed. After the alignment of the note blocks is correct play the not tuned music machine. Click on `Enable Auto-Tuner` and walk around the machine until all blocks are tuned automatically.

## NoteESP

NoteESP caches the notes played and shows pitch and instrument as block overlay. 
The `Tuning Mode` helps to just show the note blocks on the same y level as the player stands on so that the render of note blocks on different layers does not overlay.
The `Tuning Range` indicates the number of blocks on the y-axis under the feet of the player.
If `Debug` is activated the output of the note blocks is shown in chat.
