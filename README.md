# MusicTools

This plugin is made to support music machine makers with making music machines in 1.12.2. 
Since the data of instrument and pitch of a note block cannot be showed with texture packs (as it is the case in 1.13+) tuning music machines becomes a hard and tedious task. 
This plugin has been created to make this easier.

Please contact EnigmA_008#1505 on discord if you have any questions of feedback. 

## NoteESP

NoteESP caches the notes played and shows pitch and instrument as block overlay. 
The `Tuning Mode` helps to just show the note blocks on the same y level as the player stands on so that the render of note blocks on different layers does not overlay.
The `Tuning Range` indicates the number of blocks on the y-axis under the feet of the player.
If `Debug` is activated the output of the note blocks is shown in chat.

## Upcoming features
– import of nbs files from Note Block Studio
– AutoTuner for note blocks in music machines
